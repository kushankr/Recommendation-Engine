# SI650_recommendationengine
This repository contains code for a recommendation engine - (based on collaborative filtering approach)

DataSet was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recsys-2013.
The JSON used from the dataset is "yelp_training_set_review.json".
Please download it for the code to run. This can be considered a representative of the larger Yelp academic dataset.

SI650_project_v6.py can be run to get RMSE value for Pearson correlation coefficient.

SI650_project_v7.py can be run to get RMSE values for following distance measures:
“Euclidean distance”, “Manhattan distance”, “Chebyshev distance”, and “Minkowski distance”.

SI650_project_v6.txt and SI650_project_v7.txt will be generated and it will contain corresponding outputs.

One major Reference for the code is the book:
Programming collective intelligence: Toby Segaran
Other references are contained within the code.

The code takes a certain amount of time to run, so please be patient.

For further details, Please refer to the project report. 
More specifically, please refer to the collaborative filtering section of project report submitted.
